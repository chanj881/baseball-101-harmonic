 <h1>STARTING vs. BULLPEN PITCHERS</h1>
 <h3>What is a starting pitcher?</h3>
  <body>
    <p>Pitchers are the players on the center pitching mound, the ones that throw each ball. The starting pitcher is the pitcher that starts the game. The goal of a starting pitcher is to pitch for as long as possible, usually up to 100 pitches. In modern baseball, there is a rotation of 5 starting pitchers, which means starting pitchers only pitch every 4-5 days.</p>
  </body>
  <h3>What the bullpen?</h3>
   <body>
     <p>Bullpen pitchers, also known as a relief pitcher, are the pitchers that pitch after the starting pitcher leaves the mound. Bullpen pitchers usually warm up in the bullpen area to prepare for pitching later in the game.</p>
   </body>
   <h3>What a closer?</h3>
   <body>
     <p>Another type of pitcher is the closing pitcher, or the closer. The closer is usually a specialized pitcher that is responsible for the final out counts of the game. Closers usually take the mound in the 8th or 9th inning.</p>
